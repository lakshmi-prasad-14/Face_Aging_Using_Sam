# Facial Aging Using SAM

This project implements a facial aging pipeline using *Segment Anything Model (SAM)* along with deep learning techniques to simulate the visual effects of aging on human faces. It segments the facial regions, applies aging transformations, and visualizes results.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Uses Metaâ€™s Segment Anything Model (SAM) for face segmentation.
- Applies aging effects based on facial regions (wrinkles, tone, shape).
- Generates side-by-side comparisons of original and aged faces.
- Contains visual analysis like pixel intensity, facial region changes, and similarity graphs.
